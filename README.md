This work investigates the comparative performance of shortest reducts and shortest constructs in supervised classification tasks using real-life datasets from various domains, 
including both original datasets and noise-distorted variations. The study evaluates the effectiveness of the shortest reducts and shortest constructs, particularly 
in noisy environments. Experimental results provide insights into the relative performance of these attribute subsets and their impact on classification accuracy.
